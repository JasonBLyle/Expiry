The program will run if you press the green run button. To add an item, click on the FAB and then select the method you would like to use to add the item to the list.
The only possibe error is that the microphone seems to only like some devices. It works my AVDs and I was able to get it to work on my sister's phone but it doesnt run on
my phone or Adeem's AVD. If it works on your device it works perfectly or as a back up you can use the microphone build into the keyboard. Once an item is added to to the main list, swipe left to remove it or swipe right to toggle the "freezer" setting. This setting assumes the item is in the fridge / freezer and extends its shelf life accordingly. The capture activity for the barcode was imported from the ZXING open source library.
